# Minecraft Application Backup Utility
##### This was a small project I created when I was 14 to backup my minecraft worlds.

- Originally, it, as well as the user interface was created on Netbeans, but I recently converted it into an IntelliJ Project.
- I intended it to be cross platform but I never fully tested it accross all operating systems.
- The app searches for a "minecraft.jar" file to be the home directory for minecraft. I should've changed it to the actual minecraft saves folder instead as I onece encoutered a related problem because of it.
- Orginally, I saved the app/code here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/minecraft-backup-and-restore/
